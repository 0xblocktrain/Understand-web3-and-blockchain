## Why do we need blockchain?

-   We live in a very centralized infrastructure right now.
    
-   Your data is being controlled/misused by major companies.
    
-   With blockchain, you can hold your data and also get ads based on your preferences.
    
-   It’s more secure to have transactions on blockchain with no boundation.

## How does blockchain work?

-   Let’s see how a blockchain actually works
    
-   Blockchain uses some method to approve transactions known as the consensus mechanism
    
-   New blocks are added based on voting from the miners.
    
-   No one controls it, making it censor-proof
  

## Explore the blockchain

-   There are many tools that you can use to explore the world of blockchain.
    
-   Etherscan, mempool are 2 such tools
    
-   See what people are buying, selling, and doing on the chain.
    
-   You can look up any particular address or transaction on the blockchain.
    
-   One can look upto what was the transaction cost and
    

  

## Full stack decentralized app

Let’s see how a decentralized app works and looks like behind the scenes.

-   A decentralized application is similar to a centralized web app with slight changes.
    
-   We have Smart contracts as the backend and blockchains where the transactions get logged into.
    
-   The frontend is similar: HTML, ReactJS, React Native, Next JS, or anything else.
    

## Smart contracts

-   Smart contracts are the building blocks of a web3 application
    
-   These are the codes that run on the blockchain without any human interaction.
    
-   These contain logic for what to do when a function is called.
    
-   Smart contracts are inevitable, they cannot be deleted or changed.
    
-   You have to deploy it again if you change the code.
    

  
  

## Create your own coin

  

-   Let’s see how to make our own coin using simple smart contracts on Ethereum.
    
-   You can simply write a smart contract and deploy it to have your coin.
    

  
  

## Layer 1 vs Layer 2 explained![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qaG220tlkcV0mVjw8FSxebeccg2PhCkqwE0VdlUlkgrtKL1gfOEHOVZouTnw46GwQiZPixxMpyKl3LW6O1WAV64g0qWKdYXGuHRi1M_EXstoLgW18q640VUFnxAeu15P1yWQ_rFvnkGYr5bf)

  

-   These are like cake layers, the deeper you go, the tastier it gets.
    
-   Layer 1 chains are the first working concept of blockchain, they have their own infrastructures.
    
-   Layer 2 chains are built on top of Layer 1 and work similarly to them.
    
-   These layer 2 chains solve the underlying problems of layer 1 like high fee and scalability.
    
-   Layer 2 chains need not follow the same consensus mechanism as layer 1.
    

  

## Wallets

-   Your wallet is your everything in Web3, it’s like your online identity.
    
-   All transactions can be done through a single wallet and no one can restrict you.
    
-   Whosoever holds the private key owns the wallet.
    
-   You should keep the private key safe.
    

  
  

## EVM vs non-EVM

  

-   EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine, it converts solidity code to bytecode.
    
-   Chains that support EVM can run any solidity code without change.
    
-   non-EVM chains use their own language for developing smart contracts.
    
-   EVM makes it easier for code to be cross-chain compatible.
    

  
  

## Intro to Solana

  

-   Solana is a layer 1 blockchain.
    
-   It is a non EVM chain.
    
-   It uses Proof of Stake and Proof of History as its consensus mechanism.
    
-   Solana is one of the fastest layer 1 chains with a low transaction fee.
    
-   It has a growing ecosystem, with a lot of devs working on it.
    

## ERC protocols

-   ERC is a token standard for building smart contracts.
    
-   It stands for Ethereum Request for Comment.
    
-   It helps in improving the stability of smart contract development by standardizing them.
    

  
  

## NFTs

  

-   NFT stands for Non-Fungible Tokens.
    
-   Each token will have its unique property, be it metadata or name.
    
-   As they are unique, they are also known as assets.
    
-   Can be used as a Proof of Identity in some places.
    

  

## DAOs![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qmwogz8qVFakmLb0swjatnjIwKm_-pqRdTV5S7BkddefHFQI5L4Wc1oqjDCLbTjox46JfQ-icw8PQ0UbIE6qvgOp3kGNAF0RmGgUpjGtRMYV4OhM64ra1S98kb0hRipsPg575VNyk_wAiDK8)

  

-   DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
    
-   In DAO, members have the power to vote for setting any new regulation.
    
-   DAO generally doesn’t have any hierarchical structure.
    
-   They are transparent with no centralized control.
    

  

## IPFS![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/G83mVQzqk7J1_0TjW32bi8z1ZFND6YlLqdKNHsbzGltb6_n4470Hv8qR2xBCgc4h06-GWK9fr43-G17cI6TpxWYYCl3GPO7bxFsyOQeDTKlFIUWS1ez2BxAb6NS21kn0L8ufOxNZ-p1PeyRk)

  

-   IPFS is a decentralized web.
    
-   It uses peer-to-peer networks for sharing and storing data.
    
-   It makes any data unhackable and censor-proof.
    
-   Data stored on IPFS is theoretically permanent.
